			<p> I led the website development for muLab, a virtual laboratory environment for undergraduate physics experiments. </p>
			<p> Working with the design team, my job was to construct and publish a website to have the following functionality: </p>
			<ol>
				<li> Showcase and advertise the developed software </li>
				<li> House an open bank of student resources available to customers </li>
			</ol>
			<p> As part of working within a small team, I was also involved in both developing the software (written in Python) and working closely on the design elements of the product. </p>
			<p> The muLab project was successfully delivered on time and won high appraisal from the client (University College London).
