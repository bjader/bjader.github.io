			<p> I am currently teaching myself to code in C++ as part of my masters project, entitled "Entanglement Entropy of Fermions".
			Fermions are a type of particle (e.g. an electron) and I am developing an algorithm to calculate the properties of two groups of fermions that exhibit <a>quantum entanglement</a>.</p>
			<p> So far I have created a first implementation of the algorithm, which is built around a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. I am in the process of now testing the algorithm on a simple system, comparing it against the mathematical framework developed from traditional calculations. The pictures below show various expected scaling patterns for the entanglement entropy.</p>
			<p> Once the algorithm is tested to work correctly, I am hoping to apply it to significantly more complex systems that cannot be solved analytically using traditional maths. Given that entanglement entropy has never been solved for such advanced systems before, I am hoping to  be able to publish my results at the end of my project (~ May 2017). </p>
