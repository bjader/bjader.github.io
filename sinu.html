			<p> During the summer of 2016, I worked with a friend to create Sinu, an iOS app.
			<p> The motivation of the project was to learn what it takes to develop a functioning mobile app - having never created one before. Additionally, I wanted to be exposed to another object-oriented language (after learning java at university) and try my hand at swift. </p>
			<p> Sinu is a scientific calculator app, with the purpose of converting numerical quantities between Syst√®me Internationale (SI) units and natural units. </p>
			<p> Natural units are a system of units often used in particle physics, simplifying calculations by setting many of the fundamental constants in nature equal to 1. However, converting to and from natural units can be time-consuming and awkward (some of the formulas can be seen in the picture to the right). </p>
			<p> When a user swipes the page it rotates over to Nusi, a calculator that converts in the opposite direction (from NU to SI). Whilst it may not be pretty it certainly does the job! </p>
