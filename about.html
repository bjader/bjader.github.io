				My name is Ben and I'm a PhD researcher at the Unversity of Oxford.
				I strongly believe that quantum computers can offer a huge amount to
				society and will begin to find commercial significance over the next 5
				years. As such, my research is focused on developing applications for
				quantum computers and running them on the first generation of devices
				such as the ones built by IBM. It is vital that start developing
				non-trivial quantum applications now, so that they are ready to be used
				as soon as we achieve quantum supremacy. This is expected to be in the
				5-10 year range, but could be much earlier for certain specific
				problems.

				For my MSci thesis, I built a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to
				study quantum entanglement of exotic quantum materials. Interestingly,
				these materials are the same type that Microsoft are trying to build
				a quantum computer out of. This, alongside some personal coding
				projects can be found at the <p><style="color: #4dc247">projects</p>
				tab.
