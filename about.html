				My name is Ben and I'm a PhD researcher at the Unversity of Oxford.
				My research is focused on developing algorithms for
				quantum computers and running them on the first generation of devices
				such as the ones being built by IBM, and Google. It is vital that we start developing
				these quantum applications now, so that they are ready to be used once
				quantum computers surpass the computational power of classical supercomputers.
				For certain problems, this could be as close as five years away.

				For my MSci thesis, I built a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to
				study entanglement of exotic quantum materials. Interestingly,
				these materials are the same type that Microsoft are trying to build
				a quantum computer out of. This, alongside some personal coding
				projects can be found at the <span style="color: #4dc247">projects</span> tab.
