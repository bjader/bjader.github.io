				My name is Ben and I'm a Physics graduate working as a Java developer for free coffee. Specifically, my work focuses on low-level interaction with Java Memory Management and Garbage Collection technologies.

				For my MSci thesis, I built a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to study quantum entanglement and its associated entropy. I then applied my algorithm to computationally verify topological properties of the Quantum Hall Effect - itself an exciting discovery which was awarded the 2016 Nobel prize in physics. More information on my research can be found on my projects page.

				In my free time I also enjoy creating websites and apps, as well as playing table tennis and bass guitar.
